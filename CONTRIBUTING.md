## Bug reports

A bug is a demonstrable problem that is caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

### Guidelines for bug reports

1.  Check you satisfy the project requirements — https://github.com/olpok/ToDoList_new. 
2.  Use the GitHub issue search — check if the issue has already been reported.
3.  Check if the issue is already being solved in a PR — check the open Pull Requests to see if one already solves the problem you're having.
4.  Check if the issue has been fixed — try to reproduce it using the latest develop branch in the repository.
5.  Isolate the problem — create a reduced test case and provide a step-by-step instruction set on how to recreate the problem. Include code samples, page snippets or yaml configurations if needed.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report.
What is your environment? Is it localhost, OSX, Linux, on a remote server? Same happening locally and or the server, or just locally or just on Linux?
What steps will reproduce the issue? What browser(s) and OS experience the problem?
What would you expect to be the outcome?
Did the problem start happening recently (e.g. after updating to a new version of the project) or was this always a problem?

If the problem started happening recently, can you reproduce the problem in an older version? What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen? You can download older versions of th project from the releases page on Github.
Can you reliably reproduce the issue? If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.
All these details will help contributors to fix any potential bugs.
Important: include Code Samples in triple backticks so that Github will provide a proper indentation. Add the language name after the backticks to add syntax highlighting to the code snippets.
